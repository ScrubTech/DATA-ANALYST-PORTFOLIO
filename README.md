Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio!

I’m Sophia, your friendly data explorer with a knack for turning complex numbers into clear, actionable insights. With tools like Python, R, SQL, Excel, and Power BI at my fingertips, I dive into data with enthusiasm and creativity.

Here, you’ll find a collection of projects that highlight my skills in dashboard building, report writing, and data analysis. From crafting stunning visuals in Power BI and Tableau to weaving stories from data in Python and SQL, my work aims to make data understandable and decision-making a breeze.

Beyond the tech, I love solving problems and uncovering the “a-ha!” moments in data. My goal is to provide you with a portfolio that’s not just informative, but also a reflection of my passion for data analysis.

Thanks for stopping by! I’m excited to share my journey with you and would love to chat about how my skills can help make your data dreams come true.

Looking forward to connecting! 🚀📊
